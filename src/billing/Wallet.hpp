/**
 * @file Wallet.hpp
 * @brief The credit wallet's crediting/refund/adjustment service — the ONLY
 *        code in this codebase allowed to write `wallet_entries` or
 *        `wallet_balances`. Everything else (the top-up endpoint, the
 *        provider webhook, the admin adjust endpoint — the module's HTTP
 *        layer) calls into these four functions instead of touching the
 *        ledger tables directly.
 *
 * Money invariants enforced here (see migrations/007_billing.sql):
 *   - every amount is a BIGINT (cents / credits) — no floating point;
 *   - `wallet_entries` is append-only: this file only ever INSERTs into it;
 *   - `wallet_balances` is a cache kept in the SAME transaction as the
 *     ledger insert that changed it;
 *   - `credit_capture` moves `payments.credits_expected` — frozen at order
 *     creation — never a value re-derived from the current rate;
 *   - `credit_capture` is idempotent on `provider_capture_id`: the guarded
 *     UPDATE (`... WHERE provider_capture_id IS NULL`) is the structural
 *     race guard, backed by the UNIQUE index in the migration;
 *   - `refund_capture` is idempotent on the provider refund id, via a durable
 *     `billing_refunds` row written on EVERY call (applied or skipped) — NOT
 *     on payments.status and NOT on a wallet_entries row, since a skipped
 *     refund (see below) deliberately writes neither of those but must still
 *     be remembered so a redelivery can't re-decide (or worse, re-apply
 *     later once the balance happens to recover).
 *
 * `wallet_balances` upserts NEVER use a self-referencing SQL expression
 * (`SET credits = wallet_balances.credits + EXCLUDED.credits`) — every write
 * here locks the row first (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`), computes the new total
 * in C++ from that locked read, and upserts with `SET credits =
 * EXCLUDED.credits` against the explicit computed value. An earlier version
 * of this file used the self-referencing form; CI proved it does not
 * reliably read the pre-existing row inside its own ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE —
 * every write after the first for a given user silently discarded the true
 * prior balance and computed as though it were 0. Invisible for a positive
 * delta (a wrong-but-non-negative result never trips `CHECK (credits >=
 * 0)`); fatal for a negative one (a correctly-sufficient refund/debit
 * against a real balance still computed as negative and 500'd). Root cause
 * never conclusively found — forensics live in the site fork's commit
 * b676430; this file is the primary source for the corresponding "Don'ts"
 * entry in CLAUDE.md. See refund_capture's docs for the full diagnosis.
 *
 * Every write also INSERTs the row (`VALUES ($1, 0) ON CONFLICT (user_id) DO
 * NOTHING`) BEFORE the `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`, then closes with a plain
 * `UPDATE ... WHERE user_id = $1` instead of an upsert. `SELECT ... FOR
 * UPDATE` cannot lock a row that does not exist yet, so without this a
 * brand-new user's first pair of concurrent balance-changing writes (no
 * `wallet_balances` row) would both read `current = 0` with no lock held,
 * and the second writer's result would silently clobber the first —
 * `wallet_balances.credits` disagreeing with `SUM(wallet_entries.delta_credits)`
 * even though the ledger itself stays correct (a lost-update on the cache,
 * not an over-credit). Materializing the row first guarantees the `FOR
 * UPDATE` always has something real to hold, so the second writer blocks
 * and reads the first writer's committed total instead of racing it.
 *
 * `CreditResult::credited` means "this call durably recorded something new"
 * — false only for the idempotent no-op (an already-seen refund id, or an
 * already-captured order). It does NOT mean "the wallet balance moved": a
 * skipped refund (insufficient balance, or a sub-unit amount that converts
 * to 0 credits at the payment's rate) still returns credited=true, because
 * the attempt itself is now durably recorded in `billing_refunds` — see
 * refund_capture's docs below. Callers: branch on `credited` to mean "not
 * a duplicate", and inspect the payment/refund row separately for "did the
 * wallet actually move".

/**
 * @brief Idempotent refund. Converts @p refunded_amount_cents to credits by
 *        prorating the payment's frozen `credits_expected` —
 *        `credits_expected * refunded_amount_cents / amount_cents` (integer
 *        division — no floating point) — and writes a negative `refund`
 *        ledger entry IF the conversion and the current balance allow it.
 *
 *        Deliberately NOT `refunded_amount_cents * rate_snapshot / 100`: a
 *        package sale's `credits_expected` is priced independently of
 *        `rate_snapshot` (a bonus/discount package hands out more or fewer
 *        credits than the generic per-unit rate would imply — see the
 *        top-up flow), so a rate_snapshot-based conversion silently
 *        disagrees with what was actually credited. Prorating off
 *        `credits_expected` instead is exact for a full refund by
 *        construction — `(X * Y) / Y == X` for any nonzero Y, so
 *        `refunded_amount_cents == amount_cents` always yields exactly
 *        `credits_expected` back, whether the payment came from a package or
 *        a custom amount — and proportional (floored) for a partial one.
 *        `rate_snapshot` is retained on `payments` purely as an informational
 *        record of the per-unit rate in effect at purchase time; nothing in
 *        this file reads it anymore.
 *
 * ONE transaction. The durable idempotency marker is a `billing_refunds` row
 * (migrations/007_billing.sql), written on EVERY non-duplicate call,
 * whatever the outcome:

 *   1. Look up the payment by @p provider_capture_id — `FOR UPDATE`. This is
 *      what makes the aggregate check in step 3 race-safe: TWO concurrent
 *      refunds against the SAME payment (distinct refund ids, e.g. 600 and
 *      500 on a 1000-cent payment) now serialize on this row instead of
 *      both reading `already_refunded=0` and both passing. It also gives
 *      this function the same lock ORDER as credit_capture — payments
 *      first, wallet_balances second (see step 4) — so the two functions
 *      can never deadlock against each other over the same payment/user.
 *   2. Idempotency FIRST: if `billing_refunds` already has a row for
 *      @p provider_refund_id, this is a redelivery — return the existing
 *      state, write nothing. This is checked BEFORE the amount validation
 *      and BEFORE the sufficiency decision below, and it is why a
 *      redelivered refund that was previously skipped (insufficient balance,
 *      or a zero-credit conversion) stays skipped forever, even if the
 *      wallet balance later recovers enough to afford it — an earlier
 *      wallet_entries-based idempotency check could not do this, because a
 *      skipped refund never wrote a wallet_entries row at all.
 *   3. Validate @p refunded_amount_cents: must be `> 0` and
 *      `<= payments.amount_cents`, AND the running total of every
 *      `billing_refunds` row for this payment (applied or skipped — the
 *      provider's own count of what it refunded, not just what the wallet
 *      could reflect) plus this one must not exceed `payments.amount_cents`.
 *      The payments row lock from step 1 makes this sum trustworthy even
 *      under concurrent refund attempts. Either violation throws
 *      InvalidRefundAmount; the whole transaction rolls back, nothing is
 *      written — not even a `billing_refunds` row, since this refund was
 *      never a real attempt against this payment.
 *   4. Convert to credits (`credits_expected * refunded_amount_cents /
 *      amount_cents`, integer division — see the function-level note above
 *      on why this prorates off `credits_expected`, not `rate_snapshot`).
 *      `SELECT credits FROM wallet_balances ... FOR
 *      UPDATE` locks the user's balance row ONCE, up front, whatever the
 *      outcome — its value seeds the response in every branch below, and is
 *      also the sufficiency-decision input, so there is exactly one query
 *      here rather than a second one only some branches need. Two ways the
 *      credit application can be skipped, NEITHER of which may ever let the
 *      wallet_entries/wallet_balances CHECK constraints fire (that's what
 *      silently 500'd before):
 *        - `refund_credits == 0`: the amount is too small to represent at
 *          this payment's credits_expected/amount_cents ratio (e.g. 10
 *          credits for a 1000-cent payment, refund of 1-99 cents floors to
 *          0). The `wallet_entries.delta_credits <> 0` CHECK would otherwise
 *          reject the insert outright. Outcome: `skipped_zero_credits`.
 *        - the locked balance can't cover it
 *          (`current_balance - refund_credits < 0`), decided in C++ BEFORE
 *          any write, so `wallet_balances.CHECK (credits >= 0)` is never
 *          actually exercised. Outcome: `skipped_insufficient`.
 *      Either way: log at `error` for manual reconciliation, write the
 *      `billing_refunds` row with that outcome and `credits_deducted = 0`,
 *      skip the ledger insert entirely. Otherwise: ledger insert + balance
 *      upsert (the NEW total — `new_balance - refund_credits` — computed
 *      from the locked read above and set explicitly, never via a
 *      self-referencing SQL expression), outcome `applied`,
 *      `credits_deducted = refund_credits`.
 *   5. `payments.status` becomes `refunded` when the CUMULATIVE total of
 *      every refund against this payment (steps 3's running total,
 *      including this one) reaches `payments.amount_cents` AND the payment
 *      is currently `captured` — so a payment fully refunded across several
 *      partials (e.g. 400 then 600 on a 1000-cent payment) DOES end up
 *      `refunded` once the last one lands, not just a single call whose own
 *      amount happens to equal the full total. This fires regardless of the
 *      ledger outcome above (a full-by-now refund is a provider-side fact
 *      independent of whether the wallet could reflect every part of it),
 *      but a refund that leaves the cumulative total short of the full
 *      amount never touches `payments.status`, and a refund against a
 *      payment that isn't `captured` (e.g. `failed`) can't accidentally
 *      flip it either.
 *
 * All of the above commits atomically in this one transaction.
 *
 * A concurrent duplicate (two redeliveries of the same refund id racing each
 * other) loses on `billing_refunds.provider_refund_id`'s UNIQUE constraint
 * (SQLSTATE 23505) — caught below and reported as the now-idempotent
 * existing state instead of a raw 500.
 *
 * KNOWN GAP (for the webhook phase — nothing exists yet to reverse
 * anything): a refund that the provider later reverses/voids has no
 * representation in this schema. The `billing_refunds` row from the
 * original refund event would stay in place, permanently counting toward
 * the aggregate total in step 3 — a legitimate LATER refund on the same
 * payment could then be wrongly refused as "cumulative total exceeds
 * amount_cents" even though the voided refund never actually took money out
 * a second time. The webhook handler should account for this (e.g. a
 * refund-reversed event needs its own handling here, not just a bigger
 * refund) before it's reachable in production.
 *
 * @throws Repositories::PaymentNotFound if @p provider_capture_id is unknown.
 * @throws InvalidRefundAmount if @p refunded_amount_cents is out of range,
 *         single-call or cumulative.
